# üè® Hotel Reservation Analysis & Prediction Project  

**A data-driven exploration of hotel booking trends, cancellations, and customer behavior using Python, Tableau, and Machine Learning.**  

---

## üìä Project Overview  

This project analyzes hotel reservation data to uncover booking trends, cancellation patterns, and customer behavior insights. Additionally, a **machine learning model** has been developed to predict reservation cancellations based on key factors, helping hotels optimize their revenue and reduce financial losses.

## üìÇ Project Files  

1. **`Hotel Reservation.ipynb`**  
   - A **Jupyter Notebook** for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
   - Uses `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` for statistical insights.  

2. **`Dashboard.twb`** *(Primary Visualization Tool)*  
   - Interactive visualizations displaying reservation trends, cancellations, and customer segmentation.  

3. **`Hotel Reservation machine learning model.ipynb`** *(Prediction Model)*  
   - A **machine learning model** built to predict hotel reservation cancellations.  
   - Uses classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.  
   - Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

4. **`Dashboard_backup.pptx`** *(Backup Only)*  
   - A PowerPoint file containing **static** visualizations in case Tableau is not accessible.

## üéØ Key Objectives  

- Identify booking trends and seasonal variations.  
- Analyze cancellation rates and influencing factors.  
- Understand customer segmentation based on reservation behavior.  
- **Predict reservation cancellations** using machine learning models.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving hotel revenue and occupancy.

## üöÄ How to Use  

1. **Run `Hotel Reservation.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook to process and analyze the data.  
2. **Open the Tableau Dashboard** to explore interactive visualizations.  
3. **Run `Hotel Reservation machine learning model.ipynb`** to train and test the cancellation prediction model.  
4. If Tableau is unavailable, refer to **`final project.pptx`** for a summary of key findings.
